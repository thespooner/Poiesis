# Poiesis
poiesis /pɔɪˈiːsɪs/ (from Ancient Greek: ποίησις) is "the activity in which a person brings something into being that did not exist before."
## What is Poiesis?
is a tool for managing your projects, tasks, and notes. It is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use. 
It`s written with the help of Expo and React Native.
## How to use it?
Simply download the app from the App Store if I ever publish it there. Or you can clone the repo and run it on your device.
Download Expo from the App Store and install expo-cli on your computer. Then run the following commands:
```npm install```
```npm start```
## What is the current state of the project?
It is still in development. I am working on it in my free time. Unsure if I want to add calendar integration or not.
Due to the fact that react-native-community/datetimepicker is a bit tricky to use with android, only IOS is supported for now.
